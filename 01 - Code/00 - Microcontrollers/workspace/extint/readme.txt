extint
=====================
This project contains an external interrupt example for the LPCXpresso
board mounted with an LPC1343 Cortex-M3 part.

When downloaded to the board and executed, LED2 will be illuminated.
Then each time an external interrupt is triggered - by connecting P2.1
to ground - the state of LED2 will toggle.

The project makes use of code from the following library project:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx

This library project must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
