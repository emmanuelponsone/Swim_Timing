adc
=====================
This project contains an ADC example for an LPCXpresso board.

It samples each ADC channel and plots the results in an ASCII
bargraph in the LPCXpresso Console using semihosted printf.

The project makes use of code from the following library project:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx

This library project must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
